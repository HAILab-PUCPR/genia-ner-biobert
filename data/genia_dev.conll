The O
work O
reviewed O

this O

separates O
T O
cell O

into O
four O
phases O
. O

First O
is O
an O
expansion O
phase O
prior O
to O
TCR PROTEIN
rearrangement O
, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
correlated O
with O
programming O
of O
at O
least O
some O
response O
genes O
for O
inducibility O
. O

This O
phase O
can O
occur O
to O
some O
extent O
outside O
of O
the O
thymus O
. O

However O
, O
the O
profound O
T O
cell O
deficit O
of O
nude O
mice O
indicates O
that O
the O
thymus O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
potent O
site O
for O
inducing O
the O
expansion O
per O
se O
, O
even O
if O
other O
sites O
can O
induce O
some O
response O

. O

Second O
is O
a O
controlled O
phase O
of O
TCR DNA
gene DNA
rearrangement O
. O

The O
details O
of O
the O
regulatory O
mechanism O
that O
selects O
particular O
loci DNA
for O
rearrangement O
are O
still O
not O
known O
. O

It O
seems O
that O

rearrangement O
of O
the O
TCR DNA
gamma DNA
loci DNA
in O
the O

always O

at O
a O
developmental O
stage O
strictly O

the O
rearrangement O

the O
alpha CELL_TYPE

it O

how O

two O

In O
the O
TCR CELL_TYPE
alpha CELL_TYPE

however O
, O
the O
final O
gene O
rearrangement O
events O
are O
accompanied O
by O
rapid O
proliferation O
and O
an O
interruption O
in O
cellular O
response O
gene O
inducibility O
. O

The O
loss O
of O
conventional O
responsiveness O
is O
probably O
caused O
by O
alterations O
at O
the O
level O
of O
signaling O
, O
and O
may O
be O
a O
manifestation O
of O
the O
physiological O
state O
that O
is O
a O
precondition O
for O
selection O
. O

Third O
is O
the O
complex O
process O
of O
selection O

Whereas O
peripheral CELL_TYPE

undergo O
forms O
of O
positive O
selection O
( O

neither O
is O
exactly O
the O
same O
phenomenon O
that O
occurs O
in O
the O
thymic O

. O

Negative O

in O
the O
